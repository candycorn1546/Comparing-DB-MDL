# OVERVIEW

- #### Using all previously collected data from scraping Douban and Mydramalist. I build graphs and tables from Plotly to analyze the difference between Western and Eastern audiences.
- #### MDL is known as a "fandom" website, meaning ratings are more biased toward their favourite actors' shows without a fair representation of the good/bad the shows are.
- #### The average age group for MDL will be around 15-30. On the other hand, DB is used by a much more diverse group of people; therefore, their ratings will be more objective when compared to MDL.
